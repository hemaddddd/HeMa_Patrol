# HeMa_Patrol

I imported several different animations that allowed the player crouch and lean at different angle while running at different direction, the only problem is the player would go invisible while running. 
I also made the enemy and the player character able to hit each other, but I only give the enemy a health bar, so the player character won't die while being able to kill the enemy.
